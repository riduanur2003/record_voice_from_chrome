# record_voice_from_chrome


the objective is to record voice from chrome browser and save them in aws bucket


1. so the objective is to make a simple file and deploy them to AWS ECS through the help of terraform. every time 
   there is a push in master branch the system will create a docker container and push it to ECS. I guess we have to 
   create a codepipeline too.
